# BiSS C Splitter Overview

### Overview:

This BiSS C splitter is designed to deliver location requests from either a data logger or a connected motor to an encoder, and serve the position information back to the device that requested it. It is to be implemented on an an Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, although will be compatible with any Xilinx product with minor modifications in Vivado, and with any other FPGA with additional modifications. 

### General Operation:

## I/O

### 	Inputs:

* SLO In - Accepts serial position data from the encoder as a Boolean.

* DAQ Trig - Accepts a Boolean high when the DAQ requests to record data (could also take a clock signal if modified to have the same structure as the Motor BiSS C Slave)

* Motor MA- Accepts a Boolean clock signal, in line with the MA signal shown above, when the motor is requesting data.

  ### Outputs:

* Encoder MA - Outputs a Boolean clock signal at 10mhz to constantly drive the encoder.
* DAQ Out - Outputs stored serial data to the DAQ
* Motor SLO - Ouputs stored serial data to the motor, at the frequency specified by Motor MA
