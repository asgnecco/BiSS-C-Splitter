# BiSS C Splitter Overview

### Overview:

This BiSS C splitter is designed to deliver location requests from either a data logger or a connected motor to an encoder, and serve the position information back to the device that requested it. It is to be implemented on an an Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, although will be compatible with any Xilinx product with minor modifications in Vivado, and with any other FPGA with additional modifications.

## I/O

### 	Inputs:

* SLO In - Accepts serial position data from the encoder as a Boolean.

* DAQ Trig - Accepts a Boolean high when the DAQ requests to record data (could also take a clock signal if modified to have the same structure as the Motor BiSS C Slave)

* Motor MA- Accepts a Boolean clock signal, in line with the MA signal shown above, when the motor is requesting data.

  ### Outputs:

* Encoder MA - Outputs a Boolean clock signal at 10mhz to constantly drive the encoder.
* DAQ Out - Outputs stored serial data to the DAQ
* Motor SLO - Ouputs stored serial data to the motor, at the frequency specified by Motor MA

## Instructions to Run Simulation

Many of the setup requirements are already housed within the MATLAB simulation file, but there are some things that still need to be done manually. Besides the simulation file, you will also need to download the "Full Splitter Test" MATLAB document. This contains the raw data for the inputs of this splitter, to run a simulation off of. The signals can be edited by the user to test different scenarios. 

Once this file is attained, the "Connect Inputs" wizard will need to be used, from under the simulation tab on the BiSS C Splitter Simulink model. From there, the "Full Splitter Test" document can be opened. Once it has been opened, use the green play button to map to inputs, and then use the "Mark for Simulation" button to run those signals on the next test. From there, you may run the simulation through Simulink and use the Data Inspector to view the results.
